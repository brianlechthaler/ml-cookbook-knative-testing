# ML Cookbook üç≥

Welcome to the **ML Cookbook** repository! This is your one-stop guide for common use cases in training and inference of machine learning models on the **Nebius.ai** cloud platform. Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or just starting your ML journey, this repository provides practical examples, best practices, and ready-to-use code snippets to help you get the most out of your ML workflows.

## üöÄ What's Inside?

This repository is organized into **recipes** that cover a variety of ML tasks, leveraging popular tools and technologies such as:

- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: Scalable and efficient orchestration of ML workloads.
- **NVIDIA GPUs**: Accelerate training and inference with CUDA-enabled hardware.
- **Linux**: Optimized environments for ML development.
- **Open Source Tools**: Leverage the power of open-source libraries and frameworks.

Each recipe includes:
- **Step-by-step instructions** for setup and execution.
- **Code examples** for training and inference.
- **Tips and tricks** to optimize performance and avoid common pitfalls.
